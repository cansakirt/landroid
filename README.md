# Space Exploration

This project is a JavaScript re-creation of the hidden **space exploration Easter egg game** from Android 15 (Vanilla Ice Cream). While the original game was written in Kotlin/Java, this version aims to bring the same experience to the browser.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to play.

## Controls

- **Mouse Drag:** Control thrust and steer the spaceship.
- **Mouse Wheel:** Zoom in and out (if touch zoom is enabled).
- **Arrow Keys (optional):** Enable keyboard controls in the code.
- **'A' Key:** Toggle autopilot (currently non-functional).
- **'Z' Key:** Switch between zoomed-in and zoomed-out views.

## Features

- Realistic gravity simulation with gravitational pull from planets and the star.
- Spacecraft physics simulating thrust, inertia, and drift.
- Procedurally generated star systems with unique planetary arrangements.
- Basic autopilot to guide the ship between planets (currently non-functional).
- Fun landing messages when successfully landing on a planet.
